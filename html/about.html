  <h1>about</h1>
    <div class="rainbow"></div>
    <p class="p-about">This website is created to be an archive of childhood toys of the 2010s, to create a record of these toys that may have already become obsolete and lost to time, or will be in the future. So much of childhood is associated with play, so what better way to remember the past than by gathering stories of favourite play-items? </p>
    <p class="p-about">Another purpose of this site is to create a record of nostalgia for those people whose childhoods are yet too recent to become inspiration for popular works that are inspired by the nostalgia of older creators'.</p>
    <div id="spacer-sm"></div>


    <h1>disclaimers</h1>
    <div class="rainbow"></div>
    <p class="p-about">This collection is not complete nor meant to represent all toys of the 2010s... nor do all of these toys originate from or were created in the 2010s. This is meant to be a very specific time capsule of toys that were played with by a subset of former children who grew up in the 2010s, data mainly sourced from the Greater Toronto Area. This collection is meant to <i>grow</i> as more data is collected—so please consider adding to it <a href="https://forms.gle/GgF8unytw68FNDyD7">here</a>!</p>

    <h1>what counts as a toy?</h1>
    <div class="rainbow"></div>
    <p class="p-about">Toys, above all, are designed for entertainment and interactivity—thus, by this definition, many video games can be considered toys. The context of play changes as our technologies change. Video-games have been included in this archive because they are crucial tools that kids have used to bond with their friends and family. Unlike many previous generations, most children during the 2010s have grown up not knowing what it is to be without the internet or video-games, and needless to say, this has shaped their styles of play. </p>

    <h1>why are toys important?</h1>
    <div class="rainbow"></div>
    <p class="p-about">Toys have a very important role in children’s lives, being the only “profession” of their early years. They play a key role in raising self-confident, creative, happy, and healthy children. <a href=”https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8430366/”>(1)</a></p>
    <p class="p-about">Play is essential to development because it contributes to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth. Play also offers an ideal opportunity for parents to engage fully with their children. <a href=”http://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2006-2697”>(2)</a></p>
    <p class="p-about">Research shows play can improve children's abilities to plan, organize, get along with others and regulate emotions. In addition, play helps with language, math and social skills, and even helps children cope with stress. <a href=”https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/the-power-of-play-how-fun-and-games-help-children-thrive.aspx”>(3)</a></p>
