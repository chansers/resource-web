    <p id="quote-p">i liked how i could use the toys to make my own characters and give them storylines! it was also fun dressing them up with random trinkets and building up my collections to get more and more new characters. yt also recommended me a lot of videos of lps (the lps popular show had such a grip on my soul), so that probably influenced me too.</p>
    <p id="quote-p">I used to play with them everyday after school. It brings me joy that I can be creative in my own little world. Like making scenarios, new stories, new creations, etc. </p>
    <p id="quote-p">bobbly heads, so cute looking! all the LPS skits and customizing youtube videos</p>

    <p id="quote-p">i didn‚Äôt really play games as as a kid, but the ones i did were always very creative and based off world-building. it let me (literally) make my own world, but with less restrictions and more possibilities of what i can do (e.g. you can fly and make your own buildings in minecraft) without needing to spend money besides paying for the game itself.</p>
